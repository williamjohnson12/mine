<p><strong>RADAR AND LASER JAMMERS</strong></p>
<p>Radar and laser jammers takes us to the next step in electronic warfare between the police departments and the radar detector users over the use of radar or LIDAR to measure the speed level of a car.</p>
<p>While as the radar detector acts as a passive device, without giving much warning to the driver concerning the speed which is measured, a jammer emits a signal that is made to scramble the readings that the officer gets. Radar jammers are not legal under the federal law but laser jammers are legal in many jurisdictions.

<p>In the past years, radar jammers were much effective at sending out a false signal that causes an error reading on the officer radar gun. This error message enables the driver time to correct his or her speed level before another reading is read. But in recent years, nevertheless, most radar guns are digital and very difficult to jam.</p>
<p>In addition, many police radar guns are equipped with devices that are able of detecting a jammer signal. Laser jammers, nevertheless, are efficient and effective. LIDAR technology was introduced in recent months and so, it has not yet developed a level of sophistication that enables the guns to detect the effects of a laser jammer. When linked up with a high tech radar or LIDAR detector, some laser jammers can render a laser speed gun momentarily inoperable.</p>
<p>Radar and laser jammers can either be active or reactive. Active jammers changes a false return and are not legal in all 50 states in the U.S. they are also banned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>
<p>Reactive jammers takes a traffic radar microwave signal and furthers it with a chirp to it that perplexes the radar and as a result, the officer will not be capable to read the speed level of your motor vehicle.</p>
